I have used PCF8574 I²C bus expander Chip\r\nfor this purpose. This helps limited number of Raspberry Pi's pins to be better utilized. The best part is, those two pins also can be re-used because they are I²C pins, you can connect upto 127 additional devices.\r\n\r\nPlease take note that this code is based on the code posted by ufux at https://gist.github.com/ufux/6094977.\r\n\r\nSchematics : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karunadheera/lcdpcf8574/master/lcdpcf8574.png\r\n           : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karunadheera/lcdpcf8574/master/lcdpcf8574.svg\r\n","google":"UA-54111919-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
